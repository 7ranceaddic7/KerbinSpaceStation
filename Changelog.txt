Added Strategia support (nightingale)
Fixed issue where Evacuate would complete early in some circumstances.
Evacuate Mission will no longer ask you to perform an Emergency Landing on bodies without a surface (thanks CrashTestDanny)

Fixed issue where a duplicate Core Mission could be generated under specific circumstances. (thanks CompB)
