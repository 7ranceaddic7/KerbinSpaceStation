Fixed a bug that sometimes prevents CrewRotation from completing (thanks Capt Kerk)
Tier 1 and 2 Missions merged into one single Core Mission.
In order to maintain save compatibility with the above change, The "LKOStation, MunStation and MinmusStation" vessel definition obsoleted. Replaced by "LKOStationNEW, MunStationNEW, MinmusStationNEW"LKOStationNEW. (Old stations will have to re-run the Core Mission to get the new definition).
Taken advantage of nested Contract Groups to stop the pack from swamping Mission Control
